# SVC Cats and Dogs Image Classification

This is the 3rd task of my ProdigyInfotech internship,
where I made a SVC (support vector classifier) model 
which will distribute between cats and dogs. 

I used a pretrained model for feature extraction, applied PCA 
and then trained SVC on the features extracted. 

At last, I showed the main features through which played major
role in predicting the class.
